# INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Inventory Management system is created using google spreadsheet and is used to track and monitor company's Inventory across different Locations. Here, users can manually enter their product details into rows and columns to organize stock counts, check availability, and input outflow as goods are sold. The spreadsheets works best if it is being updated daily. Periodic “counts” of inventory can be performed to see where there might be waste, spoilage or theft.

An Excel-based inventory management process will not replace a true, dynamic system that you would find in a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) or other work order system, but it can be an effective basic, low-cost solution.
